With the advent of technology, almost everyone of us is a ‘photographer’. In its most simplistic avatar, a photograph speak to us, unravel stories to those who are even ignorant of its existence. While the act of capturing a photograph maybe simple, it takes a nuanced eye to capture the entire image behind the lens; images which reveal itself in its entirety.

Storytelling in the form of images have existed since the dawn of time, but in this age where access to information is rapid and easy, the photograph coupled technology can be powerful tool to disseminate tales of the world with a personal touch. 

In this podcast, we meet NatGeo explorer, photographer Prasenjeet Yadav as he shares his journey of communicating scientific stories with his able weapons,  a tripod and a camera.
