SciKick started out as a means to solve a common problem that one encounters in most research labs- to communicate the complexities of scientific problems in a succinct yet accurate way to the public. After many countless hours spent discussing possible means of reaching out, we finally decided to do a podcast that encapsulates the mind behind each solution to a problem. We realized that having a personal interaction brings out the human element behind most scientific endeavours - the countless failures and experiences gleaned after many hours of observation would be a perfect way to introduce the public to the inner workings of research.

So join us as we meet experts from various fields who constantly push new boundaries in search of the answer to the most fundamental questions about life!
